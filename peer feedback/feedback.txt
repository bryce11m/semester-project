Peer Feedback I have received:

Topic Feedback:
I asked Nate Lewis, Justin Ross, and Tyler Smith for feedback on my topic about collecting data from players that have played for the Atlanta Hawks throughout the whole teams history. All of them mentioned that they liked the idea and liked that it was topic that I would really be interested and invested in. The one thing they mentioned to me was to make sure my questions were narrowed down to one topic since there was so much information available from the website. They said to avoid broad questions and to focus on a couple of different statistics to analyze.

My response: I chose to focus my questions and research to the shooting percentages of the players. I decided I was going to group by year and position and to look at a couple statistics related to shooting and nothing else.

About the blog and streamlit app:

From Nate Lewis:

Data Collection: 
For the blocks of code I’d consider putting “python” after the ticks because it makes it a bit easier to read and more visually interesting. So in the code have it look like:
```python
{code}
```
Also to me the conclusion reads more like the conclusion for for an EDA post than a data collection post. I’d maybe even consider straight up copying and pasting that part into your EDA blog and rewriting a new one for data collection from scratch. 

EDA: 
Like you said this one is pretty rough right now but I think it’s a good jumping off point. In terms of showing the plots I just saved the plots as images and then saved them in my blog's repository in the images file. In the code for the post you then just put 

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/name_of_file.png" alt="" style="width:600px;"/>

and then it should show up as an image in your post.
 Also, I'd probably move the "Questions for Exploration" section close to the beginning of your post.

Streamlit App:
On the points per game over the years plot its pretty hard to see the dots on the scatterplot for lower ppg individuals due to the color/opacity so maybe fiddle with the settings there to improve readability. On the same plot, the label for the x-axis is currently showing up as "Unnamed: 2_level_0" so make sure to go in and fix that before the final submission.
On the shooting percentage per position section it appears that the default option for position 1 is nan so I'd probably switch that up to something else. For the plot it looks like right now its just summing the shooting percentage for each player in a certain position. I think it probably would make more sense to have this be the mean for each position instead.
Also don't forget to add the github link somewhere on your app.

Overall, I think what you have right now is a solid start and with a handful of tweaks it should be able to get that tier 1 grade.


The changes I made because of the feedback:

data collection blog post:
- I did add python to my chunks of code for the data collection blog post just so the code stood out more and was visually appealing. 
- I rewrote the cocnlusion so that it summed up what I said earlier and just restated the point and goal of the blog post. I also took the old conclusion and used it for my conclusion on the EDA blog post.

EDA blog post:
- Thanks to Nate I was able to put in each of my plots effectively with the code he gave me.
- I restructured the post so that the flow was a lot smoother. I also added detail and made sure that with each graph I answered one of the questions that I mentioned earlier in the post.

Streamlit App:
- I changed both graphs so that they were easier to follow and understand. I also cleaned up the labels. I changed up the second graph a little bit to where it showed average shooting percentages for each position.
- I added links to both my blog and GitHub Repository.
- For the first graph I changed the opacity of the colors so it stood out more and made the graph easier to follow.
